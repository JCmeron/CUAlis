<h1>Jacob Cameron
LSC 555
Assignment #2
</h1>

<p>For this system analysis and usability test, I chose to analyze the Tower Archive from 1922 to 2018 <a href="url">https://cuislandora.wrlc.org/islandora/object/cuislandora%3A67501</a>.
</p>

<h2><b>Part 1: System Analysis</b>
</h2>

<p>Inputs and Outputs
The information that goes into an information system is represented by an Input.  An input is the direct interaction between the user and the system.  Inputs of this system can be represented by the following:
</p>

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
	<th>Input</th>
	<th>Output</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Typing search terms into the search bar.</td>
	<td>Access to archived information in the database (i.e. newspapers).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Mouse clicks to access database options i.e. clicking on the option “The Tower 1981-2000.”</td>
	<td>Filtering the search results as necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>User commands (i.e. downloading a copy of a newspaper from the archive as a PDF file).</td>
	<td>Downloaded PDF files of copies of archived data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Software commands (i.e. exporting a citation of the newspaper to an external citation engine).</td>
	<td>Exported citations to desired destination.</td>
</table>

<p>Heuristic Review

This is a critique of this website as done using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristic Principles.  This critique is done with the goal in mind of testing the site to see how effective it is in finding attitudes on current events of the era.  These archived newspapers act as a window into the time and place that they were published.  A student or user could find archives such as this site effective in doing research.  Context as such that is provided by these newspapers could be crucial for research purposes and corroborating points made in research papers.

<ul>
	<li>Visibility of System Status: The visibility and speed of the system is present and very fast.  A student will not have long to wait to get to a desired webpage.</li>
	<li>Match Between the System and the Real World: Options on the site are spelled out in a plain language with easily understandable terms.</li>
	<li>User Control and Freedom: When looking at the individual entries on the site, there is highlighted text that links back to where the individual entry is stored on the site and the homepage.  If a user needs to go back to the homepage, those options are there.  There is, however, an option where the logo of the site is linked to the homepage of JSTOR which is the home of The Tower.  Not the homepage of The Tower itself.</li>
	<li>Consistency and Standards: The designs of the subpages are similar to the homepage so there is a consistent design standard.</li>
	<li>Error Prevention: If a user tries to download a copy of a newspaper, there is a window that appears confirming that the user has read the terms and conditions of the site before the download is complete.  The same warning is given in the window below where someone can create an account.</li>
	<li>Recognition Rather than Recall: Some of the text in the newspaper can be very hard to read and one may have to use the zoom function in order to properly read the text.  This could be due to the nature of what was used to write the text at the time.  The text on the site itself is easy to read.  Along with this, the search bar function is functionable but not particularly helpful in finding specific information.</li>
	<li>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: On the homepage, there are filters on the side of the page where a user can tailor their search.  An example of this is the ability to search for newspapers within a date range.</li>
	<li>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: The design is simple and straightforward.  There is no wasted space or irrelevant information.</li>
	<li>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors: The Tower itself does not offer a help or support page.  JSTOR does this through a link at the bottom of the website.</li>
	<li>Help and Documentation: The site is easy to navigate and free of complicated systems.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Part 1 Summary

The biggest strengths of the system come down to conciseness and consistency.  The system is very easy to navigate and straightforward to use at any skill level.  Every page has a consistent look and feel. <img src="Tower Search Result.jpg" alt="Tower Search Result> The biggest negatives fall to reliability and availability.  Reliability of the visibility of the text of the newspapers.  And availability of newspapers from certain times in history. <img src="Tower Newspaper.jpg" alt="Tower Newspaper>

<h3><b>Part 2: Mini-Usability Test</b>
</h3>

<p>For this test, I asked Emma Allen, a colleague of mine at the library I work at, to do two tasks:

<ul>
	<li>Use the site to explore how the CUA student newspaper has changed over the years.</li>
	<li>Imagine that you are a teacher looking for material about campus perspectives on World War II and the Vietnam War. Find two articles about each conflict that effectively illustrate some aspect about campus attitudes and activities.</li>
</ul>
Emma was engaged throughout the test.  The first thing she noticed was that the newspapers were arranged in a sequential order by years on the homepage.  She noticed that there were some changes in terms of tone of content throughout the years.  For example, starting in the 2001-2020 group, the newspaper would do an April Fools edition named The Towel.  Emma liked the general layout of the system itself.  Specifically, she stated there was a lot to be desired.  She was not a fan of the amount of dropdown menus and options in the individual entries.  She also noted that the filtering system could be improved tremendously.  When specifically looking for material on World War II and Vietnam, the search function was ineffective at finding material specific to the campus perspectives on those events.  The closest reference to anything related to Vietnam was in the November 9th, 1954 edition of The Tower.
</p>

<p>Summary of Parts 1 & 2

The findings of the heuristic analysis and the mini-usability test were similar in regards to the general layout of the system.  There were also similar findings in regards to the search function.  The search function was useful for general searches but not for looking up specific terms.  The biggest improvement I could suggest is fine tuning the search function.  If students are to use this site for research purposes, they're more than likely looking for something from a specific time period.  The search function, if done correctly, can help tremendously.
