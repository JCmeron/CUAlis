<p><b>Introdruction</b>
In June of 2024, The Volusia County Public Library system replaced its information system. This was brought about due to the contract of the previous system running out and the parent company moving its business overseas. This system to be replaced had a negative reputation among the library patrons.  Complaints generally centered around a clunky and ineffective system.  The replacement system has been received even worse than the system it had replaced.  In looking critically, the new system has three problems that have received the most scrutiny: 1. logging in to the system to see activity on a library card, 2. lack of access to loan history, 3. search results that were grouped together in a confusing manner.</p>
<p><b>Problem #1: Logging In</b>
Library patrons needed to log into the new system in order to check on due dates, status of requested materials, etc.  The information needed to log in was the patrons library card number and a six digit pin which defaulted to their date of birth (MM/DD/YY).  In the old system, the login information was the card number and a four digit pin.  Patrons were never informed of the change to the pin which caused mass confusion.  Additionally, when patrons did try to log in, they were unable to check the Remember Me option or the page would not load properly.</p>
<p><b>Problem #2: Loan History</b>
Patrons were frustrated due to the fact that their loan history was never carried over from the old system.  This serves as a way for patrons to remember what they have previously checked out.  There would be a way for patrons to turn on loan history; only new patrons and only when theyâ€™re getting their first card.</p>
<p><b>Problem #3: Search Results</b>
As seen in the <a href="https://vcplcatalog.volusialibrary.org/?section=frbr&iid=15322&currentIndex=3&frbrIndex=0&view=frbrFormatDisplayDetailsTab&branchFilters=%5B%221%22%2C%222%22%2C%223%22%2C%224%22%2C%225%22%2C%226%22%2C%227%22%2C%228%22%2C%229%22%2C%2210%22%2C%2212%22%2C%2213%22%2C%2214%22%2C%2215%22%2C%2216%22%2C%2217%22%2C%2218%22%2C%2219%22%2C%2221%22%2C%2222%22%2C%2223%22%2C%2224%22%2C%2225%22%2C%2226%22%2C%2211%22%2C%2228%22%5D&facetFilters=%5B%5D">example search result</a>, some search results are grouped together in a jumbled mess.  The new system combines similar search terms together needlessly.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
Problem #1 has been fixed and the glitch in the login system has been fixed.  Patrons also have the ability to use the Remember Me option effectively.  However, Problems 2 & 3 are still not fixed.  I would recommend simplifying the search results landing pages and having the option for loan histories to be built into the system.
